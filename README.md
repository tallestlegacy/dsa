# Introduction

As a computer science student, I never paid attention in this class and had since been procrastinating this revision.  
This repository is a review of the most common or significant data structures and algorithms that I could find, written in multiple programming languages.

- Multiple programming languages
- Asymptotic analysis
- Indepth analysis of common data structures and algorithms
- Markdown guides
- Real life applications

I hope that this helps me as much as it will help you

## Algorithms

### Searching

- [ ] Linear Search
